# Python Mastery Roadmap 🚀

This repository is my structured journey to mastering Python from the ground up.  
The goal is **professional-level fluency** in Python, covering everything from syntax → tooling → testing → async → data → packaging → performance → CPython internals.  

I’m following a **day-by-day plan** that compresses years of experience into a fast-track 4-month learning system.  
This repo holds my **daily drills, projects, and notes** as I move through the roadmap.

---

## 📅 Schedule & Format

- **Phase 1 (Months 1–2):**  
  - 5 days a week (Mon–Fri)  
  - 2 hours/day  
  - Focus: core Python, testing, iteration, async, databases, and APIs  

- **Phase 2 (Months 3–4):**  
  - 5 days a week (Mon–Fri)  
  - 3–4 hours/day  
  - Focus: Django, advanced testing, async mastery, packaging, security, databases, internals, OSS contributions  

**Daily Structure:**
1. **Learn:** Read docs or a tutorial section  
2. **Drill:** Focused coding exercises with tests  
3. **Build:** Extend a real mini-project  
4. **Reflect:** Notes + commit progress  

## 🎯 Goals

- **Phase 1 (Months 1–2)**  
  ✅ Build a CLI unit converter (`unitx`)  
  ✅ Package and test utilities (`iterutils`)  
  ✅ Write async-enabled web scraper (`news-watch`)  
  ✅ Expose scraper data through a FastAPI service with SQLite  

- **Phase 2 (Months 3–4)**  
  🔹 Learn Django & ORM deeply  
  🔹 Write robust property-based tests with `hypothesis`  
  🔹 Master asyncio & concurrency tradeoffs  
  🔹 Build a real ingestion pipeline with dataframes & profiling  
  🔹 Package and publish a utility library to TestPyPI  
  🔹 Contribute at least 1 PR to an open-source Python project

## 📌 Checkpoints

- **Week 2:** First packaged CLI tool (`unitx`)  
- **Week 4:** `iterutils` package with typing + pytest suite  
- **Week 6:** Async news scraper (`news-watch`)  
- **Week 8:** FastAPI + SQLite API serving scraped data  
- **Month 3:** Django admin app + advanced testing  
- **Month 4:** Profiling + optimized async pipelines + published package + OSS contribution

## 🔥 Stretch Goals

- Implement classic algorithms/data structures in idiomatic Python  
- Dive into CPython internals & write a minimal C extension  
- Develop a polished portfolio of projects (CLI, API, data, and OSS work)  
- Write “Today I Learned” notes along the way to reinforce learning  

---

## 📝 Progress Log

Every day I commit:
- **Code:** drills + project work  
- **Notes:** what I learned, gotchas, questions  
- **Milestones:** tagged when projects reach v1.0
