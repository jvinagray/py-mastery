Day 6-
File I/O-
With is preferred for file handling becuase it ensures that the file is closed correctly and is no longer using
system resources. f.close() also works but with is preferred because its a one shot fix.

The differece betweemn 'a mode and 'w' mode is that w would trubncate a file that existed with that name and start
clean, a is append and would add to what is already in the file.
