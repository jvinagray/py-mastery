Day 1-
Python Basics-
I started off with a fair amount of python knowledge but i want to start from the beginning to really build the foundation.
i disabled auto complete and copilot for this workspace to really force myself to learn.
Today ended up being more of a refresher on the basocs then learning but i did learn slicing
better than i knew it before and actually wrote a bunch of little functions with no autocomplete and had to debug without copilot
so i still feel like today was a learning experience.

In addition todays project was to build a CLI Temperature Unit Converter so that was fun to
learn how to use the argparse library.

Day 2- 
Data Structures in Action-
Today was a very productive day. I feel like i really grasped python data structures. My foundation is already so much better after
just two days. I learned list comprehensions which I have never actually used in practice myself but used it over and over to really
hone that skill. Dictionaries are a huge part of python and are super necessary for ds&a questions like leetcode-style and typical
coding interview stuff. All in all great day of learning and excited to continue on my journey.
